# Machine-Learning-Lab

## Topics Covered

1. Python Basics
2. Numpy
3. Pandas
4. Linear Regression
5. Logistic Regression
6. KNN(K Nearest Neighbor)
7. K-Means Clustering


## Assignments

1. Estimate parameters of a model based on Linear Regression method using a given set of training data set.
2. Write a program to implement k-Nearest Neighbour method to classify the iris data set. Print both correct and wrong predictions. Use JavaPython ML library classes.
3. Compute probability of a person to be diabetic based on a given dataset of diabetic persons using Na√Øve Bayesian classifier.
4. Apply Ensemble learning to cluster a set of data stored in a .CSV file. Use the same dataset for clustering using k-Means method. Compare the results of these two algorithms and comment on the quality of clustering. You can add JavaPython ML library classesAPI in the program.
5. Compute weights of ANN based on back propagation method using a given training dataset.
